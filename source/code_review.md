##Code Review

###Github
* Make a meaningful README with description of project, instructions for running, etc.
* Make sure all your commits and pull request messages are meaningful.  Avoid pull requests with a message of 'Chris'.  In general your commit messages are good and represent appropriately small changes to the code.


###UI
* Looks good


###CODE
* Remove all comments from final code - you need to name methods and variables so comments aren't needed.
* See comments in code with #CR
